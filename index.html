                    Working as a Full-Stack Engineer, I have successfully delivered projects
of varying scales, ranging from small to large. I have also demonstrated leadership abilities by
guiding teams and spearheading technology initiatives. As a confident and enthusiastic
presenter, I am eager to share my ideas and knowledge with others. Over the past couple of
years, I have specialized in designing cloud architecture as an IT Solutions Architect. I have a
particular interest in auditing and revitalizing old, abandoned projects, while creating
comprehensive roadmaps for their improvement which allows me to gain knowledge and
learn from the mistakes of others.</span>
                    <span class="desc">
                    In my most recent roles, I have expanded my focus to encompass broader architecture design across entire systems and organizations. I specialize in bridging the gap between technology and business—working closely with stakeholders to understand their needs, shaping strategic technical directions, and identifying solutions that effectively balance product goals with engineering constraints. This shift has strengthened my ability to create cohesive, scalable architectures that align long-term business vision with practical, high-impact technical execution.
